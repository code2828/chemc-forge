# chemc mod for Minecraft

This mod is still under heavy development.
Report bugs in the `issue` column if you notice them!

This will be a *VERY* scientific (compared to Minecraft itself and other mods like Alchemistry etc.) mod, that aims to be as scientific as possible. To give an example, lithium pickaxe would slowly convert into lithium oxide (which is poisonous) pickaxe and give you a poisoned effect.
